Password Generator with Emojis
I have created a password generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This tool helps users generate strong and secure passwords with the added fun of emojis.

Features
The password generator has the following features:

The user can select the length of the password (between 8 to 32 characters) and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or emojis.
The password is generated randomly based on the user's input.
The generated password is displayed on the screen and the user can copy it to their clipboard with a click of a button.
The interface is responsive and user-friendly, thanks to the Bootstrap framework.
Technologies Used
HTML: used to create the structure of the webpage
CSS: used to style the webpage and make it visually appealing
JavaScript: used to generate the password and handle user input and interactions
Bootstrap: used to create a responsive and mobile-friendly interface
Challenges and Learning
Creating this password generator was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I had to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional tool that met the user's requirements. Along the way, I learned how to:

Create forms and handle user input in HTML
Use JavaScript functions to generate random passwords and manipulate the DOM
Utilize Bootstrap components to create a responsive and visually appealing interface
Overall, this project helped me improve my web development skills and I'm proud of the end result. You can check out the tool [here](link to your tool).
